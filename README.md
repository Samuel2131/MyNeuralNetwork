# MyNeuralNetwork
### Simple neural network which is inspired by the sklearn library version with the possibility to optimize different hyperparameters and different functionalities.
## Functionality
* Change numbers of epochs, learning_rate, hidden_layer_sizes and tolerance;
* Set different solver(SGD, ADAM);
* Set different activation function(relu, leaky_relu, tanh, ecc...);
* Set decay;
* Set regularization;
* Set different batch size;
* Set different weight initializers;
## There are functions to monitor network performance:
* loss_graphs function;
* accuracy_score function;
* cross_entropy_loss function;
* show_results function for an overview;
## To test the model i used the iris Dataset of the sklearn library;
